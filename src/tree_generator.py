For each file, generate a new `dst_path` that includes:
- A relative folder path that categorizes the file based on its content
- A new filename based on its content, the filename should be a little more specific and detailed to the subject of the file

‚úÖ Example:
If the file is "cool.jpg" and it's a funny reaction image, then:
  "dst_path": "memes/funny_meme.jpg"

‚ö†Ô∏è Never return just a folder name as the dst_path.
‚ö†Ô∏è Always include the full path + filename + extension in dst_path.

Your response format must be:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "src_path": "original_filename.ext",
      "dst_path": "folder_name/new_filename.ext"
    }
  ]
